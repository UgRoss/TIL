# SOLID

> SOLID is a mnemonic for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

> As with everything in life, using these principles mindlessly can cause more harm than good. The cost of applying these principles into a program’s architecture might be making it more complicated than it should be. I doubt that there’s a successful software product in which all of these principles are applied at the same time. Striving for these principles is good, but always try to be pragmatic and don’t take everything writ- ten here as dogma.
