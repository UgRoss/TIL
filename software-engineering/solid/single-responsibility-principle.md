# Single Responsibility Principle

### 

### 

### Summary

Single Responsibility doesnâ€™t mean that module or a class should do one thing, instead it should have only one reason to change, or in other words, it should be responsible only, and only to one actor.  
_\(actor means a group of people who require that change\)_
