# WIP: Factory Method

### Description

**Factory method** provides an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

#### Real-life example

> While staying at the hotel, you might need to make a phone call, so you call the front desk and the person there will connect you with the number you need, becoming a "phone-call" factory, because he controls the access to calls, too.

### Example

Let's imagine we have different loggers in our applications and based on
