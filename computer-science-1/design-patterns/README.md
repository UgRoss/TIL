There are mainly 3 groups of patters:

* _**Creational Patterns **_- provide object creational mechanisms to increase flexibility and make code reusable.
* _**Structural Patterns**_ - explain how to compose objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
* _**Behavioral Patterns **_- concerned with communication between objects to make it more effective.
