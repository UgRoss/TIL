# &lt;bdo&gt;

### Description

The HTML Bidirectional Text Override element `<bdo>` overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.

### Example

```markup
<bdo dir="rtl">Hello</bdo> World!
```

You can control direction using `dir` attribute:

* `dir="rtl"` - Text goes from right to left.
* `dir="ltr"` - Text goes from left to right.
